"Intrinsic Semiparametric Mixed Effects Model for Longitudinal Manifold-valued Data"

## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel intrinsic semiparametric mixed-effects model (ISMEM) to analyze longitudinal manifold-valued data. It combines fixed and random effects on Riemannian manifolds with a semiparametric structure to retain both flexibility and interpretability. The method respects the geometric properties of manifold data and enables robust modeling at both the group and subject level.

## Real Data Experiment

We apply ISMEM to study shape changes in the left lateral ventricle (LLV) using longitudinal MRI data from the ADNI-GO and ADNI2 cohorts. Surfaces are represented in Kendall shape space after segmentation and parameterization. ISMEM accurately reconstructs both global and subject-level trajectories, outperforming competing methods such as RNLMM and LESA, especially in detecting localized anatomical deformations associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease.
